    " Groups that can be joined and left by processes, and the members of which\n"
    " can be listed on request. This may be useful for publish-subscribe\n"
    " patterns, where many processes want to receive messages another.\n"
    "\n"
    " This module is implemented using Erlang's [`pg`][pg] module and uses ETS\n"
    " for storage, so listing the members of a group is optimised for speed.\n"
    "\n"
    " Groups are tracked by group registry processes, which you should add to\n"
    " your supervision tree. Each registry is independant from each other.\n"
    "\n"
    " If a member terminates, it is automatically removed from the group.\n"
    "\n"
    " If a group registry terminates the groups are lost and will need to be\n"
    " recreated. Restarting the group registry will not recover the groups.\n"

    " ## Publish-subscribe\n"
    "\n"
    " This module is useful for pubsub, but it does not offer any functions for\n"
    " sending messages itself. To perform pubsub add the subscriber messages to\n"
    " a group, then the publishers can use the `members` function to get a\n"
    " list of subjects for the subscribers and send messages to them.\n"
    "\n"
    " ## Distributed groups\n"
    "\n"
    " If two nodes in an Erlang cluster have process registries or `pg`\n"
    " instances created with the same name (called a \"scope\" in the `pg`\n"
    " documentation) they will share group membership in an eventually\n"
    " consistent way. See the `pg` documentation for more information. Note that\n"
    " names created with the `process.new_name` are unique, so calling that\n"
    " function with the same prefix string on each node in an Erlang cluster\n"
    " will result in distinct names.\n"
    "\n"
    " [pg]: https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/kernel/pg.html\n"
    "\n"
    " ## Scalability\n"
    "\n"
    " Inserting members or getting all the members of a group `pg` is fast, but\n"
    " removing members from large groups with thousands of members in them is\n"
    " much slower. This module is best suited to numerous small groups.\n"
    "\n"
    " If you need larger groups and members to be removed or to terminate\n"
    " frequently you may want to experiment with other registries. Always\n"
    " benchmark and profile your code when performance matters.\n"
